listen = "127.0.0.1:53"
# protocol, "both", "both4", "both6", "udp", "udp4", "udp6" or "tcp", "tcp4", "tcp6"

domain = "auth.example.org"
# zone name server

# admin email address, where @Â is substituted with .
nsadmin = "admin.example.org"
# predefined records served in addition to the TXT
records = [
    # domain pointing to the public IP of your acme-dns server 
    "auth.example.org. A 198.51.100.1",
