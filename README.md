# acme-dns

A simplified DNS server with a RESTful HTTP API to provide a simple way to automate ACME DNS challenges.

## Why?

Many DNS servers do not provide an API to enable automation for the ACME DNS challenges. Those which do, give the keys way too much power.
Leaving the keys laying around your random boxes is too often a requirement to have a meaningful process automation.

Acme-dns provides a simple API exclusively for TXT record updates and should be used with ACME magic "\_acme-challenge" - subdomain CNAME records. This way, in the unfortunate exposure of API keys, the effects are limited to the subdomain TXT record in question.

So basically it boils down to **accessibility** and **security**.

## Features
- Simplified DNS server, serving your ACME DNS challenges (TXT)
- Custom records (have your required A, AAAA, NS, etc. records served)
- HTTP API automatically acquires and uses Let's Encrypt TLS certificate
- Limit /update API endpoint access to specific CIDR mask(s), defined in the /register request
- Supports SQLite & PostgreSQL as DB backends
- Rolling update of two TXT records to be able to answer to challenges for certificates that have both names: `yourdomain.tld` and `*.yourdomain.tld`, as both of the challenges point to the same subdomain.
- Simple deployment (it's Go after all)

## Usage

A Certbot authentication hook for acme-dns is available at: [https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns-certbot](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns-certbot).

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/94903.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/94903)

Using acme-dns is a three-step process (provided you already have the self-hosted server set up):

- Get credentials and unique subdomain (simple POST request to eg. https://auth.acme-dns.io/register)
- Create a (ACME magic) CNAME record to your existing zone, pointing to the subdomain you got from the registration. (eg. `_acme-challenge.domainiwantcertfor.tld. CNAME a097455b-52cc-4569-90c8-7a4b97c6eba8.auth.example.org` )
- Use your credentials to POST new DNS challenge values to an acme-dns server for the CA to validate from.
- Crontab and forget.

## API

### Register endpoint

The method returns a new unique subdomain and credentials needed to update your record.
Fulldomain is where you can point your own `_acme-challenge` subdomain CNAME record to.
With the credentials, you can update the TXT response in the service to match the challenge token, later referred as \_\_\_validation\_token\_received\_from\_the\_ca\_\_\_, given out by the Certificate Authority.

**Optional:**: You can POST JSON data to limit the `/update` requests to predefined source networks using CIDR notation.

```POST /register```

#### OPTIONAL Example input
```json
{
    "allowfrom": [
        "192.168.100.1/24",
        "1.2.3.4/32",
        "2002:c0a8:2a00::0/40"
    ]
}
```


```Status: 201 Created```
```json
{
    "allowfrom": [
        "192.168.100.1/24",
        "1.2.3.4/32",
        "2002:c0a8:2a00::0/40"
    ],
    "fulldomain": "8e5700ea-a4bf-41c7-8a77-e990661dcc6a.auth.acme-dns.io",
    "password": "htB9mR9DYgcu9bX_afHF62erXaH2TS7bg9KW3F7Z",
    "subdomain": "8e5700ea-a4bf-41c7-8a77-e990661dcc6a",
    "username": "c36f50e8-4632-44f0-83fe-e070fef28a10"
}
```

### Update endpoint

The method allows you to update the TXT answer contents of your unique subdomain. Usually carried automatically by automated ACME client.

```POST /update```

#### Required headers
| Header name   | Description                                | Example                                               |
| ------------- |--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| X-Api-User    | UUIDv4 username received from registration | `X-Api-User: c36f50e8-4632-44f0-83fe-e070fef28a10`    |
| X-Api-Key     | Password received from registration        | `X-Api-Key: htB9mR9DYgcu9bX_afHF62erXaH2TS7bg9KW3F7Z` |

#### Example input
```json
{
    "subdomain": "8e5700ea-a4bf-41c7-8a77-e990661dcc6a",
    "txt": "___validation_token_received_from_the_ca___"
}
```

#### Response

```Status: 200 OK```
```json
{
    "txt": "___validation_token_received_from_the_ca___"
}
```

## Self-hosted

You are encouraged to run your own acme-dns instance, because you are effectively authorizing the acme-dns server to act on your behalf in providing the answer to the challenging CA, making the instance able to request (and get issued) a TLS certificate for the domain that has CNAME pointing to it.

See the INSTALL section for information on how to do this.


## Installation

1) Install [Go 1.9 or newer](https://golang.org/doc/install).

2) Install acme-dns: `go get github.com/joohoi/acme-dns/...`. This will install acme-dns to `~/go/bin/acme-dns`.

3) Edit config.cfg to suit your needs (see [configuration](#configuration)). `acme-dns` will read the configuration file from `/etc/acme-dns/config.cfg` or `./config.cfg`, or a location specified with the `-c` flag.

4) If your system has systemd, you can optionally install acme-dns as a service so that it will start on boot and be tracked by systemd. This also allows us to add the `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` capability so that acme-dns can be run by a user other than root.

    1) Make sure that you have moved the configuration file to `/etc/acme-dns/config.cfg` so that acme-dns can access it globally.

    2) Move the acme-dns executable from `~/go/bin/acme-dns` to `/usr/local/bin/acme-dns` (Any location will work, just be sure to change `acme-dns.service` to match).

    3) Create a minimal acme-dns user: `sudo adduser --system --gecos "acme-dns Service" --disabled-password --group --home /var/lib/acme-dns acme-dns`.

    4) Move the systemd service unit from `acme-dns.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/acme-dns.service`.

    5) Reload systemd units: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

    6) Enable acme-dns on boot: `sudo systemctl enable acme-dns.service`.

    7) Run acme-dns: `sudo systemctl start acme-dns.service`.

5) If you did not install the systemd service, run `acme-dns`. Please note that acme-dns needs to open a privileged port (53, domain), so it needs to be run with elevated privileges.

### Using Docker

1) Pull the latest acme-dns Docker image: `docker pull joohoi/acme-dns`.

2) Create directories: `config` for the configuration file, and `data` for the sqlite3 database.

3) Copy [configuration template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joohoi/acme-dns/master/config.cfg) to `config/config.cfg`.

4) Modify the `config.cfg` to suit your needs.

5) Run Docker, this example expects that you have `port = "80"` in your `config.cfg`:
```
docker run --rm --name acmedns                 \
 -p 53:53                                      \
 -p 53:53/udp                                  \
 -p 80:80                                      \
 -v /path/to/your/config:/etc/acme-dns:ro      \
 -v /path/to/your/data:/var/lib/acme-dns       \
 -d joohoi/acme-dns
```

### Docker Compose

1) Create directories: `config` for the configuration file, and `data` for the sqlite3 database.

2) Copy [configuration template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joohoi/acme-dns/master/config.cfg) to `config/config.cfg`.

3) Copy [docker-compose.yml from the project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joohoi/acme-dns/master/docker-compose.yml), or create your own.

4) Edit the `config/config.cfg` and `docker-compose.yml` to suit your needs, and run `docker-compose up -d`.

## DNS Records

Note: In this documentation:
- `auth.example.org` is the hostname of the acme-dns server
- acme-dns will serve `*.auth.example.org` records
- `198.51.100.1` is the **public** IP address of the system running acme-dns  

These values should be changed based on your environment.

You will need to add some DNS records on your domain's regular DNS server:
- `NS` record for `auth.example.org` pointing to `auth.example.org` (this means, that `auth.example.org` is responsible for any `*.auth.example.org` records)
- `A` record for `auth.example.org` pointing to `198.51.100.1`
- If using IPv6, an `AAAA` record pointing to the IPv6 address.
- Each domain you will be authenticating will need a `_acme-challenge` `CNAME` subdomain added. The [client](README.md#clients) you use will explain how to do this.

## Testing It Out

You may want to test that acme-dns is working before using it for real queries.

1) Confirm that DNS lookups for the acme-dns subdomain works as expected: `dig auth.example.org`.

2) Call the `/register` API endpoint to register a test domain:
```
$ curl -X POST http://auth.example.org/register
{"username":"eabcdb41-d89f-4580-826f-3e62e9755ef2","password":"pbAXVjlIOE01xbut7YnAbkhMQIkcwoHO0ek2j4Q0","fulldomain":"d420c923-bbd7-4056-ab64-c3ca54c9b3cf.auth.example.org","subdomain":"d420c923-bbd7-4056-ab64-c3ca54c9b3cf","allowfrom":[]}
```

3) Call the `/update` API endpoint to set a test TXT record. Pass the `username`, `password` and `subdomain` received from the `register` call performed above:
```
$ curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Api-User: eabcdb41-d89f-4580-826f-3e62e9755ef2" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: pbAXVjlIOE01xbut7YnAbkhMQIkcwoHO0ek2j4Q0" \
  -d '{"subdomain": "d420c923-bbd7-4056-ab64-c3ca54c9b3cf", "txt": "___validation_token_received_from_the_ca___"}' \
  http://auth.example.org/update
```

Note: The `txt` field must be exactly 43 characters long, otherwise acme-dns will reject it

4) Perform a DNS lookup to the test subdomain to confirm that everything is working properly:
```
$ dig @auth.example.org d420c923-bbd7-4056-ab64-c3ca54c9b3cf.auth.example.org
```

## Configuration

```bash
